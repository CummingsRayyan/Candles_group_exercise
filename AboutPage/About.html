        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Our candles are made with soy wax which means they are vegan! Soy
            Wax is non-toxic and burns cleaner. Made with no toxins, carcinogens
            or pollutants means our candles are less likely to trigger allergies.
            It also does not give off black soot that can stain walls and curtains 
            like other leading waxes. </p>

        <h2>Our Pledge to the Environment</h2>
        <p>All our candles are made with soy wax which is a natural Ingredient
         and are far less harmful when put to flame. Soybeans are a renewable 
         resource. We ensure that Soy Wax is the best option for the whole family
         and the environment. </p>
